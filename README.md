# Bmi_calculator

**Synopsis**

This challenge was to practice Javascript and learn the most common syntax used when making a website.

**Goal**

Making a functional Bmi-calculator that we use to measure the Bmi (Body-mass index) with two variables (Weight and height) with both metric and imperial method.

**Use**

Please choose metric or imperial measurements and enter your wight and height into the corresponing fields and press calculate.
The program will then give you your Body mass index.

**Function**

I have used html for the website mockup, CSS for the styling and javascript for the logic. The webiste is launched on GIThub. Github was also used for version-control.
